#DnD5e Helpers Changelog

##1.1
- Added functionality for reseting number of legendary actions to max when a creature with legendary action counts starts their turn in combat.

##1.2
- tokens with actors that own a d6 recharge item will have its recharge rolled at the beginning of the token's turn in combat. This functions the same as if recharge was manually pressed on the sheet itself.
